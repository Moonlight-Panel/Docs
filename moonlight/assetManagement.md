### Asset Management

In Moonlight every feature can register assets (which are css, js files) which are required for displaying stuff or for interop purposes. All assets are stored in the "Assets" directory under their corresponding feature name. If you want to override a asset file for e.g. changing an image, you can use the "overrideAssets" folder. This works the same like minecraft resource packs work. Just place the file to overwrite with in the same location as the original file in the "overrideAssets" folder. So if the original file is in "Assets/Core/css/blazor.css" the override path would be "overrideAssets/Core/css/blazor.css".

If you want to register a asset as a feature developer, you can do this in the pre init phase by calling the "AddAsset" function of the context. You need to provide a name and a path. The name is the name of your feature and the path is the path to the file relative from the "Assets/YourFeatureName" folder.
